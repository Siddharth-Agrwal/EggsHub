              <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;">Eggs, natureâ€™s multivitamin, play a critical role in the global fight against malnutrition. Sight and Life is working to ensure universal access to eggs by implementing innovative, climate-smart approaches to egg production and consumption in low and middle-income countries.
                Given the mounting evidence that eggs can improve maternal and child nutrition in developing countries, we are implementing projects and new innovations in egg production, egg-based products, models, tools and approaches to address protein and micronutrient malnutrition during pregnancy, infancy, and adolescence. To support countries and partners working in this area, we have developed the eggshub website - a one-stop shop for information on egg production and consumption in LMICs, including policy publications, research studies and evaluations and success stories from around the world.
